# TLR_Framework-
TLR (Triple Layer Training) is a multi-environment reinforcement learning framework that allows AI agents to train simultaneously across multiple environments.
This novel approach enables agents to learn collaboratively, share experiences, and generalize skills across diverse tasks. By integrating shared replay buffers, prioritized experience replay, and advanced RL techniques, TLR sets a new standard for multi-domain AI learning.

Key Features

Simultaneous Multi-Environment Training: Train agents in three environments at once for collaborative learning.

Hierarchical Complexity: Structured training from simple tasks (e.g., Cart Pole) to complex challenges (e.g., Lunar Lander, Space Invader).

Advanced Replay Mechanisms:

Prioritized Replay Buffer for focused learning on high-priority transitions.

Shared Replay Buffer for cross-environment knowledge sharing.

DQN Variants:

Standard DQN for foundational learning.

Double DQN for reduced overestimation bias.

Dueling DQN for strategic action-value decomposition.

Customizable and Scalable: Easily expand to additional environments or algorithms.

Mimics human-like learning through hierarchical task complexity.

Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/TLR_Framework.git
cd TLR_Framework
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Run the example script to train the TLR agent across three environments:

python examples/train_tlr.py

Results

Training logs and metrics are saved to training_log.csv for analysis.

The terminal outputs episode rewards for each environment.

Environments

TLR currently supports the following environments:

Cart Pole (Simple Reflexive Task): Teaches basic stability and quick decision-making.

Lunar Lander (Physics-Based Task): Introduces resource management and precision landing.

Space Invader (Strategic Task): Focuses on reflexes, long-term planning, and dynamic environments.

These environments collectively challenge the agent to learn a wide range of skills, fostering adaptability and generalization.

How It Works

Replay Buffers:

Environment-specific buffers for unique transitions.

A global shared replay buffer for cross-environment synergy.

Training Pipeline:

Agents interact with all three environments in parallel.

Experiences are prioritized and shared to optimize learning.

Training metrics are logged for detailed analysis.

DQN Variants:

Each environment uses a tailored DQN variant to match its complexity.

Future Work

Expand to additional environments.

Integrate curiosity-driven exploration (e.g., ICM).

Explore meta-learning for broader generalization.

Add real-time training visualization.
